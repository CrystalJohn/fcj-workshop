### Week 7 Achievements:

- Understood Qdrant on EC2 as a self-hosted vector database: how it stores and searches embeddings and how it compares cost-wise to managed options (e.g., OpenSearch Serverless ~$90–150/month).

- Used Qdrant to:
  - Store embeddings generated by Titan Text Embeddings v2 after chunking PDF/OCR outputs.
  - Retrieve top-K vectors for queries and feed them into Claude Sonnet for RAG.

- Created a SageMaker domain and validated Bedrock connectivity:
  - Set up a simple SageMaker domain for notebook-based experiments calling Bedrock APIs.
  - Verified the end-to-end flow: send prompt → receive response from Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

- Implemented and tested Amazon Bedrock API calls:
  - Wrote sample scripts for sync/async calls, implemented retry/backoff and observed rate limits.
  - Ran batch processing experiments (multiple prompt/embedding jobs) to observe quotas and throttling behavior.

- Prompt engineering & cost management:
  - Experimented with Prompt Caching by separating System/Tool schema and Conversation History; observed reduced input tokens when reusing cache.
  - Tuned prompts for Claude Sonnet to improve answer quality while reducing token usage.

- Messaging & observability:
  - Learned the role of SQS for ingestion pipelines and SNS for alerts/notifications.
  - Understood how CloudWatch + SNS can be used to trigger alerts when workers fail or SQS backlog grows.

- Security & infra basics:
  - Studied AWS Organizations and IAM roles for managing accounts and access to Bedrock/Textract.
  - Familiarized with Amazon Macie (data classification) and the use-case for Direct Connect in on-prem integrations.

- Practical takeaway & next steps:
  - Clarified the end-to-end flow: Upload PDF → SQS message → EC2 Worker (Textract → chunk → Titan Embeddings) → index into Qdrant → RAG with Claude Sonnet.
  - Next plan: implement a sample worker on EC2 to automate ingestion workflows, measure performance, and optimize batch size/throughput.
