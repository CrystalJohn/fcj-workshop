###  [Blog 1 - Build end-to-end Apache Spark pipelines with Amazon MWAA, Batch Processing Gateway, and Amazon EMR on EKS clusters](3.1-blog1/)
This article guides how to build end-to-end Spark pipelines by combining Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow) with Batch Processing Gateway to orchestrate Spark jobs across multiple EMR clusters running on EKS. You will learn about integration, multi-cluster processing architecture, job routing and monitoring methods, as well as how to deploy a real-world environment for large-scale data systems.
###  [Blog 2 - Build Golden Images with CIS Linux Build Kit within Amazon EC2 Image Builder](3.2-blog2/)
This blog introduces how to start building a data lake in the healthcare sector by applying a microservices architecture. You will learn why data lakes are important for storing and analyzing diverse healthcare data (electronic medical records, lab test data, medical IoT devices...), how microservices help make the system more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain. The article also guides you through the steps to set up the environment, organize the data processing pipeline, and ensure compliance with security & privacy standards such as HIPAA.
