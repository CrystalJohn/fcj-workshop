During my internship at **AWS - Amazon Web Services** from **12/08/2025** to **12/11/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in the **ARC-Chatbot project - Academic Research Chatbot using Generative AI and RAG on AWS Serverless platform**, through which I improved my skills in **Python programming, system architecture design, using AWS services (Bedrock, Textract, S3, DynamoDB, Cognito), technical documentation writing, and teamwork**.  

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
