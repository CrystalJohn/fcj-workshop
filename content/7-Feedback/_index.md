### Overall Evaluation

#### 1. Working Environment

The First Cloud Journey program is truly an amazing experience. The program was designed to help me understand and experience AWS services (one of the most powerful cloud platforms). The comprehensive 12-week curriculum allowed me to progress systematically from basic AWS knowledge to deploying the **ARC-Chatbot** project — an MVP RAG Chatbot application. The weekly worklog structure helped me track work progress and learning status effectively. The environment encourages self-learning while providing adequate resources and support when needed.

#### 2. Mentor / Team Support

The guidance and team collaboration throughout the program was excellent. The team was always ready to discuss technical challenges, review my architecture proposals, and guide me through complex AWS concepts like Bedrock, Textract, and RAG + IDP pipeline. What I appreciated most was that the mentor always encouraged me to research and propose solutions before providing assistance — helping me develop independent thinking.

#### 3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major

The program content aligns well with modern cloud computing and software engineering practices. Starting from networking fundamentals (VPC, Security Groups) and progressing to serverless architecture, databases, security, and AI/ML services helped me build a comprehensive cloud engineering skillset.

The hands-on project **ARC-Chatbot** — building an AI-integrated chatbot with admin dashboard, IDP pipeline, and RAG chat — gave me practical experience directly applicable to real-world scenarios. The emphasis on Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CDK) and DevOps practices perfectly aligns with current industry standards.

#### 4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities

The 12-week journey provided me with numerous learning opportunities across many aspects:

- **Technical Skills:** Learned to use over 15 AWS services (`Bedrock`, `Textract`, `SageMaker`, `DynamoDB`, `S3`, `Cognito`, `SQS`, `Lambda`, `ECS`, `ECR`, `ALB`, `CloudWatch`, `X-Ray`, `VPC`, `IAM`...)
- **AI/ML Integration:** Learned to integrate Claude 3.5, Cohere Embeddings, RAG pipeline, and Qdrant vector database
- **Architecture Design:** Learned to design scalable, cost-effective cloud solutions
- **Documentation:** Improved technical writing skills through weekly worklogs and translating AWS blogs
- **Problem Solving:** Developed debugging skills by solving issues like rate limiting, PDF processing, and vector search optimization
- **Cost Optimization:** Learned to make architecture decisions based on cost-benefit analysis (~$65/month estimation)

The progression from **AWS Fundamentals (Week 1-4)** → **S3 & Security (Week 5)** → **Serverless (Week 6)** → **Containers (Week 7)** → **AI/ML (Week 8)** → **Architecture Design (Week 9)** → **Full Implementation (Week 10-12)** was well-paced and logical.

#### 5. Culture & Team Spirit

The FCJ program nurtures a culture of continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation. Team meetings were constructive, with open discussions about technical trade-offs and architecture decisions. Workshops like **"AWS Cloud Mastery Series"** and **"Building Agentic AI"** provided opportunities to expand knowledge beyond the core curriculum.

#### 6. Program Policies / Support

The program structure was well-designed with clear weekly objectives, comprehensive reference materials (AWS Study Group, Cloud Journey, official AWS docs), and hands-on labs. The flexibility to explore different approaches (multiple database options, vector search, PDF extraction) while staying focused on the main project was valuable.

Access to AWS accounts and guidance on budget management helped learn cost optimization from day one.
